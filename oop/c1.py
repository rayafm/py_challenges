# Employee Management
# "Age of Dragons, Inc." is growing rapidly. They need a way to keep track of all their employees. They've asked you to create an internal tool to help them manage their employees.

# Challenge
# Unfortunately, your team lead is asking you to make... an interesting design decision. She's asked you to use shared class variables to keep track of the company's name and the total number of employees inside of the Employee class. (You wanted to make a separate Company class, but she's the boss.)

# Initialize the following class variables:
# company_name set to "Age of Dragons, Inc.".
# total_employees set to 0.
# Complete the constructor:
# It takes the following parameters (in order) and sets them to the corresponding instance variables:
# first_name
# last_name
# id
# position
# salary
# Increment the total_employees class variable each time a new Employee is created.
# Add a get_name method that returns the employee's full name as a string (e.g. "John Carmack"). 

class Employee:
    # ?
    company_name = "Age of Dragons, Inc."
    total_employees = 0
    
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, id, position, salary):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.id = id
        self.position = position
        self.salary = salary 

        self.__class__.total_employees += 1
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
